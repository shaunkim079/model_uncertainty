# model_uncertainty
Code for estimating model structure errors in memory-carrying time series models assuming the error models of observational data are known.

See inside scripts folder for code for running the method in the Adaptive Metropolis scheme.
state_uncertainty_trial_gr4j_sma_likelihood_prior_AM.r contains the prior and likelihood functions of the method.

trials using 2 models:
Adaptive_Metropolis_state_uncertainty_v5.8_gr4jsmarouting_shell.r
Adaptive_Metropolis_state_uncertainty_v5.8_gr4jsma_shell.r

Input data is contained in the data folder

The rainfall-runoff model code is in the packages folder.
